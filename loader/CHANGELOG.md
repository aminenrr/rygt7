# ryGT7 launcher changelog

The launcher (RyGT7.exe) is versioned on its own with semantic versioning
(MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), separately from the game, emulator and release packages.
The version lives in `loader/Version.cs`. To release a change, bump
`LauncherVersion.Value` there and add a section here with the same number;
CI fails when the two disagree.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-11-13

* FEAT-GT7-161: Photos the game's gallery exports (Export on a Scapes or race photo) are written as
  JPEGs to a `Photos` folder next to RyGT7.exe. Set up creates the folder, updates never touch it, and
  About > Folders has a row that opens it.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-11-12

* FEAT-GTS-254: An Advanced page (last in the settings sidebar) for the renderer's experimental `RYGT_*`
  and `SHADGT_*` switches, ported from the RyGTS launcher. The launcher reads them from
  `libs\libSceVideoOut.prx` itself, with the renderer's own descriptions as hover tooltips; on/off
  switches are toggles, others text boxes. Search, sort by column, Reset all, Refresh after a renderer
  rebuild, and a table for any other environment variable. Saved as `env=` lines in `RyGT7.ini` and set
  for `GT7.exe` after the launcher's own variables. The page is hidden until About > Logging >
  "Show the Advanced page" is turned on; switches set there keep applying when it is hidden again.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-11-11

* FEAT-GTS-251: Set up no longer links the game's files into `app0` (Explorer counted the links,
  and those in every `app0.previous-*` folder, as more copies of the game): the game reads them
  from the game and update folders. Links left by earlier versions are removed, and a previous
  `app0` holding nothing else goes with them; copies are kept. ryGT7 can be on any drive.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-11

* First tracked launcher version.
* The version is in the exe's file properties (File version, Product version),
  in the launcher window, and on the first line of `setup.log`.
* CI packages record it as `launcher_version` in their build information.
